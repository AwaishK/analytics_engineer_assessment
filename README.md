* Data Versioning: Add version numbers or use sharding for tracking changes.
* Staging: Load data into a staging area for further validation.
* Data Loading: Bulk load data from the staging area into the target database.
* Post-Ingestion Validation: Verify data consistency and accuracy.
* Monitoring and Logging: Implement logging and monitoring for the ingestion process.
* Error Handling and Recovery: Capture errors and implement recovery mechanisms.
* Documentation and Reporting: Document the process and generate reports on data quality.
